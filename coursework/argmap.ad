#  Under 16s should be banned from using social media services.

[Introduction]: This map explores the proposition: "Under 16s should be banned from using social media services." In the context of increasing concern over mental health, online safety, and data privacy, this debate has gained significant attention...

## For

[Harmful Content]: Children are vulnerable to harmful, misleading, or exploitative content
 + <Explicitly Innparopriate Content>: Pornography, violence, hate, dangerous trends and challenges, malicious users
 + <Exploitative Content>: Advertisements, scams, grooming 
 + <Ideological Content>: Extremism, radicalization, misinformation, conspiracy theories
 - <Platforms offer content moderation tools>: Platforms offer content moderation tools to help users filter out harmful content
    -> <Tools are not effective>: Tools are not effective in filtering out harmful content

[Mental Effect of Social Media]: Cognitive, emotional, and mental health development is at risk
 + <Impact on Brain development>: Social media can affect brain development, leading to addiction and cognitive impairment
 + <Increased risk of mental health issues>: Social media can lead to increased anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues
 - <Early exposure builds resilience>: Early exposure to social media can help children build resilience and coping skills
    -> <Resillience requires guidance>: Resilience requires guidance and support from parents and educators
 
[Inadequate Moderation and Monitoring]: Inadequate parental supervision and platform responsibility
 + <Parents are digitally illiterate>: Many parents lack the knowledge and skills to monitor their children's social media use effectively
 + <Platforms are not responsible>: Social media platforms often do not take responsibility for the content shared on their platforms
 - <Why not fix the system?>: Why not fix the system instead of banning under 16s from using social media?
    -> <Fixing the system is difficult>: Fixing the system is difficult due to the complexity of social media platforms and the need for cooperation between parents, educators, and platforms
    -> <Banning under 16s is easier and temporary>: Banning under 16s from using social media is a simpler solution that does not require significant changes to the system

## Against


[Social Connection and Bonding]: Social media supports emotional connection and bonding
 + <Enables long-distance friendships>: Social media enables long-distance friendships and connections with family members
 + <Unstable and unpleasant home environments>: Life at home sucks
 + <Helps reduce anxiety and isolation>: reduces loneliness
 + <Used to arrange face-to-face social events>: organise meet ups
 - <Prmotes exclusion and bullying>: Social media is a site of exclusion and bullying
    -> <Not unique to Social Media>: enough said
    -> <Ban will destroy support systems>: lets not just ban everyone

[Educational Value of Social Media]: Social media can be a valuable educational tool
 + <Platforms differ in educational value>: youtube better than tiktok
 + <Decreases inequality>: state students can use free social media education
    -> <Can still access online resources>: but they aint as good
 - <Some social medias are not educational>: but are becoming it 

[Cycle of Digital Illiteracy]: Banning under 16s from social media could lead to a cycle of digital illiteracy
 + <Children require early guidance>: Children need early, guided experience to learn safe digital habits, ideally by tutors and parents who understand
 + <The cycle continues>: Children will become the next digitally illiterate parents
 - <They can learn later>: its only until they are 16 
    -> <Early experiences shape life and intiution>: might be too late
