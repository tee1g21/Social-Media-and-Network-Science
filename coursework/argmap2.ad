[Under 16s are exposed to harmful content on social media]: Social media can expose under 16s to inappropriate, explicit and harmful content, often without any deliberate search.
    + [Sexual Content]:  The EU kids online study [(European Parliament, 2023)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/733109/IPOL_STU%282023%29733109_EN.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) reported that 33% on average of children aged 9-16 had been exposed to sexual content/pornography, with this figure surpassing 40% in Croatia, Czech Republic, Malta, Serbia and Spain, and passed 61% for 15-16-year-olds. A further study [(Andrie et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34682190/) found exposure to sexual content was more pronounced in males who 'displayed dysfunctional internet behaviour', suggesting that exposure to this content can lead to negative behavioural effects. 
        + [Grooming]: Beyond exposure to sexual media, an evidence review [(Stoilova, Livingstone, et al., 2021)](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/71817/ssoar-2021-livingstone_et_al-The_4Cs_Classifying_Online_Risk.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y) found that up to 17% of minors surveyed had received "sexual solicitations" from adults online, highlighting the alarming threat to under 16s that is grooming. 
    + [Explicit and Hateful Content]: The EU study also highlighted the "numerous instances" of hateful, illegal and gory content viewed online by under 16s, with over 10% of children encountering content that relates to self-harm, drug use or and pro-anorexic rhetoric. Furthermore, in some EU countries, up to 48% of children had received hateful messages directed towards them, including persuasion to cause harm to oneself, verbal assault and purposeful exclusion [(European Parliament, 2023)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/733109/IPOL_STU%282023%29733109_EN.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com). This online hate was often targeted, with "24% of 13-18-year-olds" experiencing abuse relating to their sexuality, gender, religion, race, disability or transgender identity. 
    + [Advertisement Exploitation]: // In 2017, investment in digital advertisement overtook television for the first time [(UNICEF, 2018)](https://www.unicef.org/childrightsandbusiness/media/256/file/Discussion-Paper-Digital-Marketing.pdf). 
    Enhanced by social media, digital advertisement has enabled the rise and success of profit-driven personalised ads based on user data [(Montgomery, Chester and Kopp, 2024)](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/costs-targeted-advertising-children-and-mental-health). These targeted advertisements pose a threat to children, praying on their inability to distinguish misinformation and breaching their privacy. [Fairplay and Global Action Plan](https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbsurveillancereport.pdf) found that 82% of 16-17-year-olds have encountered over-targeted advertisements which make them feel uncomfortable, with Facebook's targeting system allowing exposure to ads for alcohol, gambling, and weight-loss products.  
    + [Ideological Manipulation]: Social media can affect the political and ideological development of inherently impressionable children before their critical thinking abilities are fully established. [Research from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2024/feb/social-media-algorithms-amplify-misogynistic-content-teens?utm_source=chatgpt.com) found TikTok's algorithm to "amplify misogynistic content to teens" and revealed that these hateful ideologies have migrated from social media into school environments, permeating "mainstream youth culture".  
    +> <Ban Limits Harmful Content Exposure>: I strongly believe that under 16's exposure to this harmful content should be minimised and ban from social media would contribute to this.   
    -> <Remove & Filter Harmful Content>: Children's exposure to harmful content could be prevented through content removal and filtering systems. However,
