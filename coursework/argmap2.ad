[Under 16s are exposed to harmful content on social media]: Social media can expose under 16s to inappropriate, explicit and harmful content, often without any deliberate search.
    + [Sexual Content]:  The EU kids online study [(European Parliament, 2023)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/733109/IPOL_STU%282023%29733109_EN.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) reported that 33% on average of children aged 9-16 had been exposed to sexual content/pornography, with this figure surpassing 40% in Croatia, Czech Republic, Malta, Serbia and Spain, and passed 61% for 15-16-year-olds. A further study [(Andrie et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34682190/) found exposure to sexual content was more pronounced in males who 'displayed dysfunctional internet behaviour', suggesting that exposure to this content can lead to negative behavioural effects. 
        + [Grooming]: Beyond exposure to sexual media, an evidence review [(Stoilova, Livingstone, et al., 2021)](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/71817/ssoar-2021-livingstone_et_al-The_4Cs_Classifying_Online_Risk.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y) found that up to 17% of minors surveyed had received "sexual solicitations" from adults online, highlighting the alarming threat to under 16s that is grooming. 
    + [Explicit and Hateful Content]: The EU study also highlighted the "numerous instances" of hateful, illegal and gory content viewed online by under 16s, with over 10% of children encountering content that relates to self-harm, drug use or and pro-anorexic rhetoric. Furthermore, in some EU countries, up to 48% of children had received hateful messages directed towards them, including persuasion to cause harm to oneself, verbal assault and purposeful exclusion [(European Parliament, 2023)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/733109/IPOL_STU%282023%29733109_EN.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com). This online hate was often targeted, with "24% of 13-18-year-olds" experiencing abuse relating to their sexuality, gender, religion, race, disability or transgender identity. 
    + [Advertisement Exploitation]: // In 2017, investment in digital advertisement overtook television for the first time [(UNICEF, 2018)](https://www.unicef.org/childrightsandbusiness/media/256/file/Discussion-Paper-Digital-Marketing.pdf). 
    Enhanced by social media, digital advertisement has enabled the rise and success of profit-driven personalised ads based on user data [(Montgomery, Chester and Kopp, 2024)](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/costs-targeted-advertising-children-and-mental-health). These targeted advertisements pose a threat to children, praying on their inability to distinguish misinformation and breaching their privacy. [Fairplay and Global Action Plan](https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbsurveillancereport.pdf) found that 82% of 16-17-year-olds have encountered over-targeted advertisements which make them feel uncomfortable, with Facebook's targeting system allowing exposure to ads for alcohol, gambling, and weight-loss products.  
    + [Ideological Manipulation]: Social media can affect the political and ideological development of inherently impressionable children before their critical thinking abilities are fully established. [Research from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2024/feb/social-media-algorithms-amplify-misogynistic-content-teens?utm_source=chatgpt.com) found TikTok's algorithm to "amplify misogynistic content to teens" and revealed that these hateful ideologies have migrated from social media into school environments, permeating "mainstream youth culture".  
    +> <Ban Limits Harmful Content Exposure>: I strongly believe that under 16's exposure to this harmful content should be minimised and ban from social media would contribute to this.   
    -> <Remove & Filter Harmful Content>: Children's exposure to harmful content could be prevented through content removal and filtering systems. However, 

[Social Media Poses Mental Health Risks to Under-16s.]: Social Media can negatively effect the emotional wellbeing and brain development of children, as well as contributing to  mental health challenges.  
    + [Brain Development and Cognitive Function]: Maza et al. [(Maza et al., 2023)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2799812) conducted a study with 169 "sixth and seventh grade students", investigating the effect of "habitual checking behaviours" on brain development. The adolescents who habitually checked social media displayed different patterns of brain development, particularly in regions linked emotional importance, motivation and cognitive control. These findings suggest that early exposure to social media may permanently alter under 16's neural response to "social rewards and punishments", via physical changes to their brain. 
    + [Increased Anxiety, Depression and Worsened Sleep]: Research suggests that there is a direct correlation between adolescent social media usage and increases in "mental distress" and moderate to extreme self-harm tendencies [(Khalaf et al.)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10476631/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Khalaf et al. suggest that the overuse of mobile phones, especially before bed, is causing chronic sleep loss, negatively impacting cognitive function, schoolwork, and social-emotional regulation. Similarly, Pirdehgan et al. [(Pirdehgan et al.)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233562/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) found a statistically significant correlation between social media and poor sleep, particularly for teenage boys, as well as social media and depression. Social media is clearly harming the mental health of adolescents.  
    + [Social Comparison]: As someone who's adolescence heavily involved social media usage, both t\hrough my own and my peers, I think it is important to acknowledge the social comparison that is caused and amplified by social media. Looking back, we often failed to recognise the unrealistic portrayal of people's lives that were posted online, especially celebrates, leading some individuals to feel pressured to exaggerate their own lives online, creating a detrimental cyclic effect. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem for those viewing this content and can also promote feelings of low self-confidence for those actively posting online. When encountered at such a crucial age, these feelings are particularly challenging and can have lasting effects, potentially shaping negative emotional responses to social situations later in life. 
    +> <Banning Social Media would improve Under 16s mental health>: It is clear that social media has a negative effect on the mental health of under 16s, removing it would prevent this. 
    -> <Mental Health Problems are caused by external factors>: Many of these issues are and were present without social media and are caused by external factors, only exacerbated by social media. If we treat these external factors, under 16s maybe able to use social media healthily. 

[Parents and Platforms struggle to protect Children] 
    + [Parents cannot manage]: Parents cannot manage or regulate the social media use of their under 16-year-old children. A study published by Ofcom[(Ofcom, 2023)](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/research-and-data/media-literacy-research/children/childrens-media-use-and-attitudes-2023/childrens-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2023.pdf?v=329412) investigated social media use for children aged 3 to 17, including their parents views and management methods changes as their children age. For ages 3-4, only 21% of parents spoke to their children regarding their online usage and 25%
