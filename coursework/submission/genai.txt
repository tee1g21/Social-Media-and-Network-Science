Social Media Protection Balance
user
can you help me reduce the word of my position below. I want a concise conclusion and summary of my thoughts as I am already above the word count 

[My Position]: I do not fully align with either side of this argument. 
    +> I strongly believe that Under 16s should be protected from harmful content, times that I personally encounted explict content on social media as a child were extremely disturbing and in some cases harrowing, a social media ban would prevent this experience for the majority of children. 
    +> I believe that social media can benefit and impair the mental health of under 16s. Therefore I think that a better solution to this issue would be to educate children how to navigate social media healthily and regulate their emotions as suggested by McAlister et al., keeping the positives of mental health use. 
    +> I strongly believe that the educational resources available on social media must remain in place, I believe that a blanket ban is not an option due to this, and if a ban were to be implemented it would need detailed regulations ruling what is allowed. 
    +> I think a large part of the danger of social media is due to digital illiteracy of parents and them not being able to manage their children usage. If we ban under 16s from social media, we are preventing them from learning these key skills during their formative years, potentially creating the next generation of digitally illiterate parents. If we allow children to use social media, they will be digitally literate and will be able to teach their kids how to use social media healthily, creating a future where under 16s can reap the benefits of social media whilst negating the dangers.

Here's a more concise and polished version of your position, preserving your nuanced stance while cutting down on word count:

---

**[My Position]:** I hold a nuanced view.  
+> I strongly believe under-16s should be protected from harmful content—my own disturbing experiences with explicit material online show the need for safeguards. A ban could prevent such harm for many children.  
+> However, social media also offers benefits, especially for mental health and education. Instead of a blanket ban, we should educate young users on emotional regulation and healthy use, as suggested by McAlister et al.  
+> The digital literacy of both children and their parents is key. A ban may hinder essential digital skills, leading to future generations of digitally illiterate parents. Teaching responsible use now builds a safer, more informed future.

I think i want it as one paragraph so that my opinion forms fluidly through the end. starting with what I think would be good about a ban and then progressively ending with my slightly anti ban opinion. Also you removed some of the power and persuasive language from my original one don't do that, this is supposed to convince people 
ChatGPT
Thanks for the clarification — here’s a revised single-paragraph version that keeps your persuasive tone, begins with the potential benefits of a ban, and flows naturally toward your more nuanced, ultimately anti-ban position:

---

While I understand the appeal of banning under-16s from social media—especially to shield them from the disturbing and sometimes harrowing content I personally encountered as a child—I believe the issue is more complex. Social media can both harm and support young people’s mental health, and a blanket ban risks throwing out the good with the bad. Instead, we should empower children to navigate these platforms healthily and regulate their emotions, as McAlister et al. recommend. Moreover, social media is a powerful educational tool that must not be lost to overbroad restrictions. Crucially, I believe much of the danger stems not from children’s access itself but from widespread digital illiteracy among parents, which limits their ability to guide and protect their children online. If we prevent young people from developing these skills now, we risk raising yet another generation of digitally vulnerable adults. By teaching responsible use rather than enforcing prohibition, we create a future where children are safer, savvier, and better equipped to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

this is my draft of my introduciton, what do you think, can you help me reduce words and smooth out the clutter

[Introduction]: The use of social media by under 16s is as divisive topic as ever as the online social industry continues to expand rapidly. With most common social media platforms setting age requirements at 13+ [(OpenView Education, 2025)](https://www.openvieweducation.co.uk/social-media-age-ratings/), this argument explores whether this age should be increased to 16 for all social media, enforced by legislation. As inferred from the provided proposition, a "ban" in the context of this argument refers to a blanket restriction across all social media "services" for under 16s; a social media service refers to any "interactive technologies which facilitate the creation, sharing and aggregation of content amongst virtual communities" [(Wikipedia, 2025)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media). The European Parliament recently published an official study examining how social media effects the development of children [(European Parliament, 2023)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/733109/IPOL_STU%282023%29733109_EN.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), highlighting the importance of finding a solution to this argument which permanently protects the safety of under 16s in an ever more online world.

Yes, it makes sense and is grammatically correct. However, for slightly smoother flow and stronger clarity, you could revise it just a bit:

**Option 1 (polished but similar):**  
*This online hate was often directed at individuals based on their sexuality, gender, religion, or membership in other marginalized groups.*

**Option 2 (more formal):**  
*Much of this online hate targeted individuals for their sexuality, gender identity, religion, or association with other marginalized communities.*

<Poses Mental Health Risks>: 
    + [Brain Development and Cognitive Function]: Maza et al. [(Maza et al., 2023)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2799812) conducted a study with 169 "sixth and seventh grade students", investigating the effect of "habitual checking behaviours" on brain development. The adolescents who habitually checked social media displayed different patterns of brain development, particularly in regions linked emotional importance, motivation and cognitive control. These findings suggest that early exposure to social media may permanently alter under 16's neural response to "social rewards and punishments", via physical changes to their brain. 
    + [Increased Anxiety, Depression and Worsened Sleep]: Research suggests that there is a direct correlation between adolescent social media usage and increases in "mental distress" and moderate to extreme self-harm tendencies [(Khalaf et al.)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10476631/?). Khalaf et al. suggest that the overuse of mobile phones, especially before bed, is causing chronic sleep loss, negatively impacting cognitive function, schoolwork, and social-emotional regulation. Similarly, Pirdehgan et al. [(Pirdehgan et al.)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233562/?) found a statistically significant correlation between social media and poor sleep, particularly for teenage boys, as well as social media and depression. Social media is clearly harming the mental health of adolescents.  
    + [Social Comparison]: As someone who's adolescence heavily involved social media usage, both through my own and my peers, I think it is important to acknowledge the social comparison that is caused and amplified by social media. Looking back, we often failed to recognise the unrealistic portrayal of people's lives that were posted online, especially celebrates, leading some individuals to feel pressured to exaggerate their own lives online, creating a detrimental cyclic effect. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem for those viewing this content and can also promote feelings of low self-confidence for those actively posting online. When encountered at such a crucial age, these feelings are particularly challenging and can have lasting effects, potentially shaping negative emotional responses to social situations later in life. 
    + <Banning Social Media would improve Under 16s mental health>: It is clear that social media has a negative effect on the mental health of under 16s, removing it would prevent this. 
    - <Mental Health Problems are caused by external factors>: Many of these issues are and were present without social media and are caused by external factors, only exacerbated by social media. If we treat these external factors, under 16s maybe able to use social media healthily.

Moving house or changing schools is a common experience for many children. Throughout my childhood, somewhat unluckily, many of my close friends moved away for varying reasons. Without social media platforms such as Instagram, I believe I would have felt far more isolated during these times, negatively impacting my mental health. Social media allowed me to maintain close friendships despite physical distance, something which would have been much harder without it.

this argument needs massively reducing 

<Another Pandemic Situation>: Nearly six years ago, everyone's work, academic and social lives very quickly moved to an entirely online setting. For under 16s, their academic and social lives would be most effected in the event of another global pandemic. As someone who experienced the pandemic through the age of 16 onwards, I strongly believe that a lack of social media would have been extremely detrimental to my mental health due to increased feelings of isolation and loneliness as suggested by McAlister et al.. As well as this, my education would have been further negatively impacted without the online learning available on social media. 

ChatGPT
Here’s a much more concise version of your argument that still conveys your key points and personal perspective:

---

**<Another Pandemic Situation>:** In a future pandemic, under-16s would face increased isolation without social media. From my own experience during COVID-19, social media was vital for staying connected and supported my mental health. It also provided valuable educational content that helped me stay engaged in learning.

[Learning Resources]: Social media can supply learning resources to children alongside their school education, especially for GCSE qualifications. During my GCSE revision I found third-party online learning resources, mostly from youtube, equally useful if not more useful for learning and understanding concepts; the shear quantity of free high quality learning resources on Youtube is very beneficial to under 16s from an Educational context. [Fernández-Torres et al., 2021](https://repositori-api.upf.edu/api/core/bitstreams/7cd2bfc3-172d-4775-9730-673d67abfefb/content) investigated how teens are using Youtube. They found that education was within the top five uses of Youtube by teens, banning them from this site would undoubtedly harm their education.
        + [Levels The Playing Field]: Unfortunately, in this country and many others, not all children receive an equal education. In 2024, UK private schools greatly outperformed state school GCSE results, with 48.8% of privately educated students achieving a Grade 7 or above compared to 19.4% in state schools [(The Guardian, 2024)](https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2024/aug/22/gcse-results-day-news-updates?utm_source). By banning under 16s from social media, we would strip state school students from excellent learning resources which would allow them to achieve better grades, widening the gap to private schools. As someone who both went to a state school and heavily relied on social media to achieve academic success, the concept of removing this educational avenue for under 16s angers and frustrates me. I strongly disagree with a social media ban that would involve this.
    - [Not all Social Media is Educational]: However, some Social Media platforms are more educational than others, such as Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, which focus on visual short form content which captures user attention. TikTok recently added the "STEM" feed, which focuses solely on educational content, to all users by default [(TikTok, 2024)](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-stem-feed-now-available-to-all-users-by-default), suggesting that social media companies are moving in the right direction from an education point of view. I believe that a social media ban should specifically exclude educational content. 

ChatGPT
Here’s a significantly tightened version of your section. It retains all key arguments, evidence, and persuasive tone while reducing word count and avoiding repetition:

---

**[Learning Resources]:** Social media can provide valuable educational support alongside school learning, particularly for GCSEs. During my revision, I found free resources on platforms like YouTube as effective—if not more so—than traditional materials. The sheer volume of high-quality content benefits under-16s academically. [Fernández-Torres et al., 2021](https://repositori-api.upf.edu/api/core/bitstreams/7cd2bfc3-172d-4775-9730-673d67abfefb/content) found education was among the top five reasons teens use YouTube; banning access would clearly harm learning.  
 + **[Levels the Playing Field]:** Educational inequality persists—2024 GCSE results show 48.8% of private school students earned Grade 7+, compared to just 19.4% in state schools [(The Guardian, 2024)](https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2024/aug/22/gcse-results-day-news-updates?utm_source). Removing access to free social media-based resources would disproportionately hurt state school students and widen the attainment gap. As someone from a state school who relied heavily on these tools, I find such a ban deeply unfair.  
– **[Not All Platforms Are Educational]:** While some platforms (e.g. Instagram, TikTok) focus on short-form content, changes like TikTok’s new default “STEM” feed [(TikTok, 2024)](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-stem-feed-now-available-to-all-users-by-default) show growing educational intent. Bans should be nuanced, preserving access to educational content rather than eliminating it entirely.

change this to still comment on the fact that not all social media is educational which is a valid point

Here’s a revised version that keeps the valid criticism—acknowledging that not all social media is educational—while still supporting a nuanced approach:

---

While many platforms, like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, are dominated by short-form, entertainment-driven content, this doesn’t mean they lack educational potential. For example, TikTok recently introduced a default “STEM” feed to promote learning-focused material [(TikTok, 2024)](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-stem-feed-now-available-to-all-users-by-default). These steps suggest social media can evolve to support education, so any ban should be carefully targeted—restricting harmful content while preserving access to valuable learning resources.

Got it! Here's a version that first presents the critique—that not all social media is educational—and then includes a rebuttal that acknowledges recent improvements:

---

**– [Not All Social Media Is Educational]:** While some argue that social media supports learning, many platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok primarily promote short-form, entertainment-focused content designed to capture attention rather than educate. Much of what under-16s consume may be distracting or even harmful rather than helpful for their development. However, recent changes—such as TikTok’s introduction of a default “STEM” feed [(TikTok, 2024)](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-stem-feed-now-available-to-all-users-by-default)—show that platforms are beginning to recognize their educational potential.
